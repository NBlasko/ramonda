 * two distinct ones share a name.
 *
 * The length only decides whether that assertion ever fires — and firing is expensive, because the
 * name is already written into the emitted JavaScript by then. So it is set to make the assertion a
 * tripwire that never trips: at 16 hex characters, 200,000 blocks give 1.1e-9. Measured, the extra
 * characters are free — 8, 12 and 16 hex all gzip to the same 46.7 KB, because the name is the part
 * that repeats. See DESIGN.md.
